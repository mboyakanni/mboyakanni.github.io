      <p>
        When it comes to getting fresh seafood in the Rockies, nobody knows the
        industry like Seattle Fish Co. In 1918, Mose Iacino built a thriving
        business centered on ingenuity, customer service and quality seafood.
        Although Seattle Fish Co. has grown exponentially, we remain a family
        company at heart.
