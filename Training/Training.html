      <h1>Maize Farming Course</h1>
      <h3>Course Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Maize remains one of the most common crops in Nigeria. It grows well in
        almost every state in Nigeria and produces high yields making it one of
        the most profitable farming ventures. Because maize is used for both
        human and animal feed, and is still useful for industrial purposes, any
        farmer investing in maize farming should expect to make a respectable
        earning. However, things must be done properly to guarantee maximum
        yield.
      </p>
      <p>
        With growing emphasis being placed on farming, it is important that you
        focus on gaining more expertise in your field.
