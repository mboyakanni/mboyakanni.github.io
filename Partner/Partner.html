        Building a thriving, long-term seafood industry relies on strong
        partnerships among retailers, importers, producers, NGOs, fishermen, and
        governments. The Fishin’ Company has many close partnerships with
        leading organizations that are deeply committed to the growth and
        sustainability of the seafood industry, and we are honored to work with
        them toward common sustainability goals.

        The Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) and its certifying body, Best
        Aquaculture Practices (BAP), have been driving factors in building an
        ever-growing aquaculture industry that can be trusted and is dependable.
        The Fishin’ Company has supported and partnered with GAA and BAP for
        many years, and we wholeheartedly believe in their commitment to
        constant improvement.

        The Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) works to develop fisheries
        and aquaculture efforts into sustainable and responsible sources of
        seafood. Their leadership and expertise in all areas of seafood
        sustainability have led to the transformation of many crucial fisheries.
        The Fishin’ Company has supported SFP in numerous Fishery Improvement
        Projects (FIPs) and Aquaculture Improvement Projects (AIPs) around the
        world by providing market support, financial resources, supplier
        roundtable presence, and more.

        The Global Seafood Sustainability Initiative (GSSI) Benchmarking Tool is
        the first collective and non-competitive approach to provide clarity on
        seafood certification worldwide. GSSI will publicly recognize seafood
        certification schemes that meet GSSI Components grounded in the Code of
        Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the FAO Guidelines for seafood
        certification and eco-labelling. As a strong supporter of GSSI, we
        pledge to include the outcomes of the GSSI Benchmark Tool in our daily
        operations by recognizing all GSSI-recognized certification schemes as
        acceptable when sourcing certified seafood. We encourage companies
        across the seafood sector worldwide to join in our commitment.

        The Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program helps consumers and
        businesses choose seafood that is fished or farmed in ways that protect
        sea life and habitats, both now and in the future. Their recommendations
        indicate which seafood items are “Best Choices” or “Good Alternatives”
        and which ones you should “Avoid.” They seek to raise public awareness
        about sustainable seafood issues through resources like their consumer
        guides, mobile apps, and outreach efforts. As a partner, we commit to
        selling only environmentally responsible seafood and to helping
        transform the marketplace in favor of more responsible fisheries and
        aquaculture operations.
