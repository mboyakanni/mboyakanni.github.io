      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <h3>EAT FISH!</h3>
      <p>
        At the Fish Farmer, we believe in eating well and respecting our
        environment. Our fish are given space to swim in the ocean with tides
        and current and given time to grow so the textures are firm and
        natural-tasting. We farm fish without any growth enhancements. More than
        70% of our farm is made of recycled materials and we use renewable solar
        energy for power. <i>Love Seafood, Love the Sea.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this millennium, scientists predicted there would be a sharp drop in
        wild catch from the sea due to global warming, over-fishing and
        pollution. In 2007, CEO Malcolm Ong decided there is a need for fish
        farming. Fish farming is similar to growing trees. We can’t keep cutting
        down trees; we have to replant trees to sustain the forest. Similarly,
        we can’t keep catching fish; we have to farm fish to sustain the oceans.
        And hence The Fish Farmer was founded to provide fresh, safe &
        sustainable fish to the local market.

          We learnt farming techniques from traditional farmers who were farming
          for decades. So we built more than 100 caged long nets along sheltered
          waterways. This allows our fish to swim and exercise with the tides
          and absorb the natural nutrients and the sea environment. Therefore
          our fish has a firm texture, no mud taste and has the same flavour as
          wild-caught fishes. The Japanese call this flavour Umami which means
          pleasant savoury taste. We don’t rush our fish - each fish is given
          time and space to grow. It takes a year to grow to plate size and more
          than 2 years to grow to fillet size. Our fish are entirely naturally
          grown, without any growth enhancements. We adhere to the strict rules
          for food safety set out by the Singapore government. The Fish Farmer
          is the only farm in Singapore with the widest variety of fish. We are
          proud to boast that we are the largest producer of Mullet, Milkfish,
          Red Snapper and SeaPerch.

          While some individuals venture into aquaculture, becoming a farmer was
          like coming home for Malcolm Ong. Malcolm entered the realm of
          aquaculture after meeting and befriending traditional fish farmers
          following his success as Managing Director of a French software
          corporation. The Fish Farmer's four farms now produce a wide range of
          fish and fish-based food items, including grey mullet, milkfish, red
          snapper, barramundi, and sea perch, thanks to his leadership.
